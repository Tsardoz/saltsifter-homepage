## Setup Required

### Form Backend Configuration
The waitlist form requires a backend service to handle submissions. Choose one:

#### Option 1: Formspree (Recommended)
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and create account with sifter@saltsifter.com
2. Create a new form in dashboard
3. Copy the form ID (looks like: xabc1234)
4. In `waitlist.html`, replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID
5. Example: `https://formspree.io/f/xabc1234`

#### Option 2: Netlify Forms (Zero Setup)
1. If deploying to Netlify, uncomment the Netlify form tag in `waitlist.html`
2. Comment out the Formspree form tag
3. Deploy - forms will automatically appear in Netlify dashboard
4. No additional configuration needed

#### Option 3: Custom Backend
1. Build your own form handler
2. Update form action URL to point to your endpoint
3. Ensure CORS headers are set for frontend domain

1. **Test Submission** - Fill out form completely and submit
2. **Check Email** - Verify email arrives at sifter@saltsifter.com
